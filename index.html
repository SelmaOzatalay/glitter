          <p>Glitter may sparkle and shine, but it's a bit of a villain when it comes to the environment. Most glitter is made from tiny pieces of plastic, and since it's so small, it easily ends up in places it shouldn't—like oceans, rivers, and wildlife habitats. When it’s washed off after crafts or makeup, or even when it's left behind on your clothes, glitter particles slip through the cracks of recycling systems and can't be properly cleaned up. This means it contributes to microplastic pollution, which is harmful to marine life and even ends up in the food chain. So, while glitter may give your project that extra sparkle, it’s not exactly a friend to the planet. Sustainable glitter alternatives made from biodegradable materials are out there, but traditional glitter’s environmental impact is still a major issue!</p>
